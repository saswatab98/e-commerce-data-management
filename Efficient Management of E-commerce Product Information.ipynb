    "    Collects comprehensive information about a new or existing product from the user, validates the input, and updates the respective dictionaries with product details, sales data, and descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This function performs a series of prompts to the user to input the SKU, sales data for the last 14 days, product details (including name, brand, model, specifications, price, and availability), and a product description. Each input is validated for specific criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The SKU must be exactly 13 characters long.\n",
    "    - Sales data must consist of exactly 14 whole numbers, representing sales for the last 14 days.\n",
    "    - Product details and description inputs are collected without specific validation but are required for successful product registration.\n",
